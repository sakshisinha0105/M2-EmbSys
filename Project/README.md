### **1. INTRODUCTION**
After the novel Corona Virus outbreak, govt. and public around the world have finally pushed themselves towards the hygienic way of living and proper sanitation.
People are using proper sanitation processes and trying to make their work place, house etc. sanitized as much as they can. Sanitizers, temperature sensors and mask have become mostly equal to mandatory and we can also see govt. providing these things in the vastly used public areas. 
So, here i am introducing a system or say a project that has capability to provide basic sanitation in public as well as private places. Our systemâ€™s crucial features are: Sensing temperature, dispensing sanitizer and vending mask. 
We can use this system at crowded, mild-crowded and private places for better and basic sanitation to all the beings passing through the system.

####  **1.1 Problem Statement**
Looking at the current pandemic situation, we have various kit and systems for precaution from the flu which are sort of expensive and unavailable at some areas of the country.
As we have seen and experienced that people forget about the sanitation and keeping mask with them when they go out.
People take temperature fluctuation of the body very lightly that might increase the chances of spreading the flu.

#### **1.2 Motivation**
Looking at the current scenario of this epidemic, we are proposing an idea of complete precaution system which sense your body temperature, remind and vend you mask and provide sanitizer.
This system promotes contactless body temperature sensing.
The system is affordable and can be used at private as well as public levels.
This system promotes sanitation and hygienic habit in every person to prevent us from these kind of flu and contagious diseases.
